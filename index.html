					<p>
						I found a great love for computers as a child when I saw my
						grandfather in his 60s in a Microsoft Office course for its great
						utility. Seeing as still his age, he tried to adapt to technology to
						see how to simplify his tasks by performing them in a simpler and
						more efficient way. Dedicated. Able to effectively self-manage
						during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a
						productive team.
